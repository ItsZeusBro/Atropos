# Atropos
## Attropos is used to return the result of a Moira Machine and insert it back into a Hydra Result context.

### Atroppos completes the Moira Machine's single threaded job. 
#### Hydra does not care "how" this gets done. It only cares about the Artifact that is returned as a Result to the Hydra context that contained the Routine sent into Moira.
